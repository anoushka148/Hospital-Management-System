# Hospital-Management-System
The Hospital Management System (developed in C# using a 3-layer architecture) is a comprehensive information system designed to manage all facets of a hospital. This system encompasses various panels for administrators, doctors, patients, rooms, staff, accounts, and more.

Some key features include:

Management of admin, doctor, patient, room, and staff information
Prescription management
Comprehensive tracking of records, including positions and the ability to add, remove, or update information
Different panels and access levels for various users along with their associated information
Processes for discharging patients, approving requests, and managing allocations for admins, doctors, patients, and rooms
Availability tracking, hierarchical structures, associations, and appointment scheduling
The primary goal of this system is to optimize and digitize processes within a healthcare institution, leading to enhanced customer service, reduced operational costs, and more efficient access to medical records, billing information, and details about patients and doctors. This results in a well-organized database for each implemented module.
