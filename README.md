# Hospital-Management-System
The Hospital Management System, developed in C# using a 3-layer architecture, serves as a comprehensive information system to oversee all functions within a hospital. This system features panels for administrators, doctors, patients, rooms, staff, and accounts.

Key functionalities include the management of admin, doctor, patient, room, and staff data, as well as prescription management. It tracks all records, allowing for the addition, removal, and updating of information. Different user panels and access levels are available, along with features for discharging patients, approving requests, and managing allocations for admins, doctors, patients, and rooms. The system also includes tracking for availability, hierarchies, associations, and appointment scheduling.

The primary goal of this system is to optimize and digitize the various processes within a healthcare institution. This approach enhances customer service, reduces operational costs, and streamlines access to medical records, billing information, and details about patients and doctors, resulting in a well-organized database for each implemented module.
